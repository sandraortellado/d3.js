          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There is a relatively strong negative correlation between obesity rate and median income level in US states. Washington DC and Hawaii have the some of the lowest obesity rates as well as the highest incomes whereas Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas have the highest obesity rates and the lowest median incomes. A closer look at the states that stray from this trend line (outliers like Colorado that have a low median income but also the lowest obesity rate in the US) could inform an analysis of the effectiveness of different state health policies and spending plans.</p>

          <p>Though the data given was not explicitly explained, assumptions can be made about how these rates are measured. Obesity rate is likely a percentage of the population in each state, and income is for each state is likely a median income, which is a better measure of central tendency than the mean, especially for income.</p>

          <p>Likewise, visualizing this data requires careful considerations for improving the ease of consumption of information for the viewer. In this case, decreasing the radius of each point, adding tool tips and labels for each point, and adjusting the domain of the x and y axes helps insure a clear, precise, and accurate understanding of the data.</p>
